# for-loops-numpy
This Python script explores NumPy broadcasting by comparing its built-in functionality with a manual implementation using nested loops. It also converts a structured dictionary into a NumPy array, making the data more accessible and readable. The script ensures accuracy with assertions and provides clear output comparisons.
